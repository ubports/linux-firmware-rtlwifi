# Realtek Linux firmware

This repository contains nonfree, binary firmware for Realtek WiFi chipsets. It is repackaged here for use on the PinePhone.

If you'd like to update this package, copy the new rtlwifi files from [kernel.org's linux-firmware.git](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/) and bump the changelog to the day you made the update.
